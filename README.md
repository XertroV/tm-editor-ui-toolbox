# Rescale Editor UI

Trackmania 2020 Editor UI Rescaling + other utilities, particularly WRT the inventory (block/item selection folders at the bottom of the editor screen -- the stuff that takes up too much space).

In non-main editor UIs (like custom items, media tracker, etc) the UI should be untouched (please report it as a bug if not, or request it as a feature if you want that).

Features:
- Rescale & Move Editor UI
- More room to place blocks
- Auto-hide inventory (works in fullscreen)
- Hide map info (top right corner green box)
- Show labels for blocks/folders in the inventory
- Customize the 'Hover Indicator' (the hover thing is required for the UI scaling method to work)
- Customize colors / appearance of elements
- Some lighting stuff that may or may not help with lightmap stuff
